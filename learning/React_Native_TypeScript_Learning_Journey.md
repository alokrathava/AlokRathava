   - Sharing logic across components using custom hooks.

4. **Introduction to Dependency Injection (DI):**
   - Understanding the concept of Dependency Injection.
   - Benefits of using DI in React Native.
   - Implementing DI using TypeScript and React Context API.
   - Using DI with libraries like inversifyJS or tsyringe.

**Practice:**
- Refactor your existing app to use TypeScript more effectively and implement DI for better code management.

### Week 5: Advanced Topics, Native Modules, and MVVM Refinement
**Goals:**
- Learn how to integrate React Native with native code and refine the implementation of MVVM and DI.

**Topics:**
1. **Working with Native Modules:**
   - Understanding the bridge between JavaScript and native code.
   - Creating simple native modules (iOS with Swift, Android with Kotlin).
   - Linking and using native libraries in React Native.

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Profiling and improving performance in React Native apps.
   - Optimizing images, handling large lists, and reducing app size.
   - Using React Native's useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo for performance.

3. **Refining MVVM and DI:**
   - Implementing advanced MVVM techniques, such as handling complex UI states.
   - Using DI to manage dependencies in ViewModels and services.
   - Testing and debugging ViewModels and DI setups.

4. **Animations:**
   - Introduction to animations in React Native.
   - Using the Animated API for creating smooth animations.
   - Exploring libraries like react-native-reanimated and react-navigation.

**Practice:**
- Implement advanced MVVM and DI patterns in your app, integrate animations, and explore creating a native module.

### Week 6: Testing, Firebase Integration, Deployment, and Final Project
**Goals:**
- Test, optimize, and deploy a comprehensive app with Firebase integration.

**Topics:**
1. **Firebase Introduction:**
   - Setting up Firebase in a React Native project.
   - Firebase Authentication: Implementing user sign-up, login, and authentication flows.

   - Deploying to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

**Project 6:** **Social Media Feed App with Firebase**
- **Description:** Create a social media feed app where users can post updates, like, comment, and share content. Implement full MVVM architecture, use Dependency Injection, and integrate Firebase for user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates. Ensure the app is fully tested and optimized for deployment.
- **Focus:** Comprehensive project combining all learned concepts: MVVM, DI, Firebase integration, state management, navigation, testing, and deployment to app stores.
