## 1. Modular Component-Based Structure

The system has been redesigned to separate components into distinct, modular services that enhance scalability and management. The core components include:

- **Front-End (User Interface)**:
  - Website
  - Dashboard
- **Back-End Services**:
  - KYC and AML Processing
  - CRM Module
  - Reporting and Analytics
  - Staff Augmentation Services
  - Customer Support
  - Publishing Engine
- **Data Layer**:
  - Centralized Database
  - Data marts for CRM, Analytics, and Subscription

## 2. Proposed High-Level Workflow

### Front-End
1. **Website**:
   - Displays general information.
   - Allows access to registration, login, and subscription flows.
2. **Dashboard**:
   - Provides a unified user interface for all customer-facing features (e.g., analytics, subscriptions, publishing tools).

### Back-End Services
1. **Authentication & User Management**:
   - Manages user registration, login, and authentication (with multi-factor authentication).
   - Integrates with KYC/AML systems.
2. **Subscription Management**:
   - Handles subscription plans, renewals, and payments.
3. **CRM Module**:
   - Manages customer data, engagement, and feedback.
   - Includes lead tracking, communication tools, and analytics.
4. **Publishing Module**:
   - Allows users to build and publish websites.
   - Integrates with AML systems to check for compliance.
5. **Analytics & Reporting**:
   - Processes user and business data for insights.
   - Provides visual dashboards for both users and admins.
6. **Customer Support Module**:
   - Ticketing and live chat system for customer queries.
   - Integrated with CRM for seamless tracking.

### Data Layer
1. **Database**:
   - Central repository for storing:
     - User profiles.
     - Subscription data.
     - CRM records.
     - Logs and analytics.
2. **Data Pipelines**:
   - Real-time syncing of user activity into analytics and CRM modules.

### Third-Party Integrations
- **AML/KYC**: Automate compliance for users and published content.
- **Payment Gateways**: Handle subscription transactions.
- **Marketing Tools**: Integrate email campaigns, lead generation, and ads.
- **External APIs**: Enable integration with other platforms as needed.

## 3. Technical Architecture Layers

### 3.1 Presentation Layer
- **Components**:
  - Website
  - Dashboard
- **Technologies**:
  - React, Angular, or Vue.js for front-end development.
  - Responsive design for multi-device access.

### 3.2 Application Layer
- **Microservices-Based Architecture**:
  - KYC/AML Service
  - CRM Service
  - Subscription Service
  - Analytics Engine
  - Publishing Engine
- **Technologies**:
  - Node.js, Django, or Spring Boot for API development.
  - REST or GraphQL APIs for communication.

### 3.3 Data Layer
- **Databases**:
  - Relational Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) for transactional data.
  - NoSQL Database (MongoDB/Redis) for faster data retrieval.
- **Data Warehousing**:
  - Use a warehouse like Snowflake or Amazon Redshift for analytics.

### 3.4 Infrastructure Layer
- **Cloud Hosting**:
  - AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for hosting scalable services.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**:
  - Automate deployment with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD.
- **Containerization**:
  - Use Docker and Kubernetes for deploying and managing services.
- **Load Balancing**:
  - Implement with cloud load balancers for better traffic management.

1. **User Interactions (Website & Dashboard)**:
   - Registration/Login → Subscription → Dashboard Access.
2. **Back-End Processing**:
   - KYC & AML checks → CRM Interaction → Subscription Management → Publishing & Analytics.
3. **Third-Party Services**:
   - Payment Gateway → AML/KYC Integration → Marketing Platforms.
4. **Data Flow**:
   - Real-time data syncing between CRM, Analytics, and Reporting modules.

## 5. Key Improvements

1. **CRM as a Central Hub**:
   - Integrates with subscription, analytics, and customer support to provide a unified view of customer activity.
2. **Scalability**:
   - Microservices architecture ensures components can scale independently.
3. **Automation**:
   - Automate tasks like subscription renewals, lead nurturing, and compliance checks.
4. **User-Centric Dashboards**:
   - Provide detailed, real-time insights into subscription and activity metrics for both users and administrators.
5. **Improved Compliance**:
   - AML and KYC checks occur at every stage (registration, publishing, payments).
